# Python Learning, Scrappy, and DSA Learning in JS

This repository is dedicated to my journey in learning Python (referred to as Oython in my work), Scrappy (Scrapy framework), and mastering Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) using JavaScript. As I continue to build my skills, this repo will serve as a collection of projects, code snippets, and learning resources.

## About Me

Hi! I'm Mugesh Rao D, a full-stack and blockchain developer, and the founder of a startup. I'm passionate about building innovative solutions to major challenges, with expertise in technologies like JavaScript, Solidity, React, TypeScript, and Python. 

My work includes creating applications for industries like agriculture, focusing on solutions such as a peer-to-peer heavy machinery rental platform. I'm constantly learning and exploring new concepts, whether it's enhancing my skills in Python, diving deeper into Scrapy for web scraping, or improving my problem-solving abilities in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

In this repo, you'll find:

- **Python Learning**: Python tutorials and personal learning experiments.
- **Scrappy**: My exploration and experiments with Scrapy, a Python framework for web scraping.
- **DSA in JS**: A collection of Data Structures and Algorithms problems solved using JavaScript, aiming to enhance my problem-solving abilities and coding efficiency.

## Contents
